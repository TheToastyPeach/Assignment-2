                <p> 
                    Conventional white and brown eggs are sourced from brown and white chickens. The most popular process is the use of housing systems to collect eggs from the animals. These housing systems are furnished and provide space for the animals to move around freely. These kinds of eggs are the most common and typically on the cheaper side of the market.

                <p>
                    Free run hens are kept in a barn or aviary and allowed to run free while living and nesting in simian systems to nest eggs. While they’re allowed to run free, they still live within enclosed systems. Free range are also raised in a similar system but the birds allowed to roam free outside. If the birds are fed certified organic feed, they can be considered and sold as organic eggs. These eggs take more effort to produce so are typically more expensive than the alternatives with organic being one of the most expensive options

                <p>
                    Certain birds are given specialized feed to produce eggs with various qualities. These include: omega-3 rich eggs, vitamin-enhanced, and vegetarian eggs. Specialized eggs all hold a more specific use case and vary in cost. The other kind of specialized eggs being factory altered eggs. These eggs have other ingredients	added to them or properties removed to alter the basic form of the egg. These include things like egg whites or yolks only, formulas for cooking or colouring for cosmetic baking.

                    How the chickens are raised and treading while they are producing eggs can effect the rate of laying, egg size, and the egg quality. Although these factors also depend on the age of a chicken, it’s important to consider how the chickens that laid your eggs are raised and treated throughout their life. The feed also changes the quality of eggs but increases the cost. This is why its important to not always choose the cheapest egg! Many low prices eggs come from factories where chickens are mistreated and live shorter lives due to confinement. Although the proximity of cages is often considered a bad thing, research shows that  the floors that chickens in barns are exposed to cause more contaminates to be in contact with the eggs as advance cage systems allow droppings to be separated from the chickens living space. Unfortunately, the use of low quality feed, little space given outweighs the positives that come with raising the chickens in a more open and natural environment. As they are social birds, there’s no way to simulate the pecking order that’s incorporated when the birds are in a free environment. It’s important to consider all factors when choosing an egg to buy.</h3>

                    Touched on briefly in the Chickens section, these social birds suffer in factory environments. Their inherit nature goes against the artificial space in the factories. They often cramp the birds in small confined spaces inducing stress and lowering their quality of life. Many alternatives to raising and caring for chickens are preferred over this style.
